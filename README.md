## Description

The code implements seashell pattern formation based on a modified Fowler model. The project includes:


- Turing instability analysis and Hopf bifurcation analysis for the activator-inhibitor system model
- Finite element method, variational formulation, semi-implicit scheme to simulate seashell patterns over time
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks to identify initial conditions and parameters for the modified Fowler model
